# Mahine-Learning-Regression-Project

This project uses NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and SciKit-Learn regression models to predict the price of bulldozers. The project uses data from the Blue Book for Bulldozers challenge on Kaggle. 
To run the code, download and extract the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data) and place it in a 'data' folder.
